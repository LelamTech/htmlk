<p>My first Class was Amazing</p>
<p>It was a bit weird at first but it's starting to get normal.I think it's because of my high school friends that i got upto speed with the new scary environment...ofcourse everyone's new but for the it's different because they've been staying at the city all this while.Nairobi is not your usual backyard it's a really vast and scary environment that would swallow a ambitious young man from the Country side.</p>

<p>Life isn’t  fair to all .most of us go through a lot but we still stand strong yet it doesn’t seem to be enough .we really try to build our wall up high so as to sometimes fell appreciated but the walls we build come down crushing on us.i don’t wanna talk much but all I can say is I’ve really tried to be myself and accept myself.sometimes I hide my real identity just to make others fell comfortable around me.the past week has not been the best for me lots have happened and my besty was not around so it was really tough.one thing I thank myself for is standing up for me and fighting all the negative thoughts .i don’t wanna get depressed and with my besty here I believe it won’t happen.i’ll be strong coz I won’t let people take me down ……………</p>
