    <h2>Nairobi</h2>
    <p>In Kenya there are only four incorporated cities including the capital and largest city, Nairobi, the second largest and the coastal city of Mombasa, the third largest and inland port city of Kisumu and the newly elevated City of Nakuru that was upgraded from a Municipality to a city by President Uhuru Kenyatta on December 1, 2021. Two of the four cities, Nairobi and Mombasa are cities whose county borders run the same as their city limits, so in a way they could be thought of as City-Counties. Apart from these four cities, there are numerous municipalities and towns with significant urban populations.Nairobi is famous for being the only capital city that contains a national park. The city's proximity to Nairobi National Park has given it the name of 'the safari capital of Kenya'.</p>
